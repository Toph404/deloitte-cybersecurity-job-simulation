# Analysis Notes â€“ Deloitte Cybersecurity Simulation

## Task Summary
- Investigated web activity logs from Daikibo Industrials.
- Identified automated and suspicious user behavior.
- Determined possible breach entry points.

## Key Insights
- Learned how to interpret structured log data.
- Understood VPN tunneling and internal vs. external network access.
- Practiced incident investigation and reporting skills.

## Reflection

During this Deloitte Cybersecurity Simulation, I analyzed internal web activity logs from Daikibo Industrials to identify suspicious behavior and determine potential breach points.

I learned how **VPN tunneling** separates internal systems from the public internet, meaning attackers cannot directly access the dashboard without valid credentials or VPN access. This reinforced the importance of **identity-based security** (e.g., MFA, credential hygiene).

By examining timestamp patterns and API requests, I detected automated activity from a specific user ID performing **hourly API calls** without loading page resources, clear evidence of scripted behavior. This exercise strengthened my **incident investigation and reporting skills**, including identifying anomalies, correlating data, and communicating findings clearly.

Key takeaways:
- Understood how VPNs secure internal dashboards and limit attack surfaces.  
- Gained practical experience in log analysis and threat detection.  
- Practiced documenting incidents and recommending mitigations
